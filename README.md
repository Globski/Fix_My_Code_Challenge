# Fix My Code Challenge Projects

This repository contains a collection of debugging challenges across various programming languages. Each task is designed to help you identify and fix issues in existing codebases without having to recode everything from scratch. This hands-on experience will enhance your problem-solving and debugging skills. Participants will work on snippets of broken code, identify issues, and apply fixes to ensure the code functions as intended. The project features multiple tasks, each requiring different approaches and techniques based on the programming language used.
